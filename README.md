# Simple Site Unblocker
This is a very simple site unblocker that uses iFrame to run.<br>
Some sites may not support iFrame, making it very simple.<br>
FULL credit to VillainsRule.
## Testing
It is still possible to block ALL iFrames, hence, there is a test you should run first to ensure these are unblocked.<br>
This test is made to be very short.
## Usage
I used my bookmarklet-maker repository's format.<br>
It wasn't hard to convert it. Overall, it is very clear what to do.
## Code
The code is purposefully very simple, and should be open for everyone.
## Deployment
The code is deployed to Github Pages and can be found [here](https://villainsrule4000.github.io/site-unblocker).
